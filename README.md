# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. I will clean the NYC bike sharing data from August 2019 and create a number of graphs to draw conclusions in Tableau.  More specifically, I will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/andreabassetti/bikesharing/blob/main/png/Top%20Starting%20Locations.png)
This graph shows all of the starting locations of each bike sharing trip. The intensity of the color or the size of the bubble represent the number of rides at each location. As expected, the most popular starting stations are in Manhattan. There is a relatively even spread of popular starting locations, indicating that the bike sharing program is pupular in the city as a whole and not in just an area. The count of the rides in Brooklyn are smaller, but nonetheless remain proportional across the area. 

![Top Ending Locations](https://github.com/andreabassetti/bikesharing/blob/main/png/Top%20Ending%20Locations.png)
This graph shows all of the ending locations of each bike sharing trip. The intensity of the color or the size of the bubble represent the number of rides at each location. As expected, the most popular ending stations are in Manhattan. There is a relatively even spread of popular starting locations, indicating that the bike sharing program is pupular in the city as a whole and not in just an area. The count of the rides in Brooklyn are smaller, but nonetheless remain proportional across the area. In Brooklyn you can see that the ending point where most rides end are close the bridges and metros that are closest to Manhattan. This present an interesting pattern about the movements of NYC residents. 



## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
